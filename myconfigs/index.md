# Useful configuration files

Want to spice up your command-line goodness? Here are the configuration files that I use and keep up to date on GitHub.

* My [.vimrc](https://github.com/andymeneely/scripts-settings/blob/master/se-dept/.vimrc) has some helpful commands. 
* My [.vim/](https://github.com/andymeneely/scripts-settings/blob/master/se-dept/.vim) directory has the various plug-ins and other things I've installed.
* My [.bashrc](https://github.com/andymeneely/scripts-settings/blob/master/se-dept/.bashrc) My bash config file... complete with git completion, customized prompt, aliases, and other bash goodness.
* My [.gitconfig](https://github.com/andymeneely/scripts-settings/blob/master/se-dept/.gitconfig) with some helpful aliases.
